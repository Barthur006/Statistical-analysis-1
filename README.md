# Statistical-analysis-1

This project is divided into three parts , where the first part is exploring a gender discrimination about 
salaries in banks, followed by sitting and MTL thinkness research @Siddarth2018. The final section is about
simulating two normal distribution 
 
### Section 1 
Gender discrimination in bank salaries. In the 1970’s, Harris Trust was sued for gender discrimination
in the salaries it paid its employees. One approach to addressing this issue was to examine the starting
salaries of all skilled, entry-level clerical workers between 1965 and 1975. 

In this project, i will explore the relationship between age, experience, education and salary.I will try to 
check why seniority employees should e controlled.

### Section 2
Sitting and MTL thickness. @Siddarth2018 researched relations between time spent sitting (sedentary
behavior) and the thickness of a participant’s medial temporal lobe (MTL) in a 2018 paper entitled, “Sedentary
behavior associated with reduced medial temporal lobe thickness in middle-aged and older adults”. MTL
volume is negatively associated with Alzheimer’s disease and memory impairment.

Developing predictive model to be used in predicting the sitting. Linear regression would be used in the modeling.

 ### Section 3
 Simulate two Normally distributed random variables X1 and X2 with correlation 0.8, both should have a mean value of 70 and a standard deviation
 of 8. See https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter5/5_3_2_b
ivariate_normal_dist.php equation 5.23 for formulas that will help you see
how to do the simulation. There are other ways to do this as well. 
Think of X2 as a score on the second exam in a class, and X1 as the score
on the first exam.

Finding the relationship between the two exams and find some analytical 
Statistical summaries.
